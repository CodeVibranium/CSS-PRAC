          <quote>
            "Perhaps one reason we are fascinated by cats is because such a
            small animal can contain so much independence, dignity, and freedom
            of spirit. Unlike the dog, the cat’s personality is never bet on a
            human’s. He demands acceptance on his own terms." — Lloyd Alexander
